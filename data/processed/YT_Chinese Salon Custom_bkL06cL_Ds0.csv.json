We tried using Rosetta stone but the main problem was that it was a female voice... so we were both kinda doing \"high pitched japanese\" instead of what we should be sounding like. I also found out my name is exclusively a female name in Japan lol.\n\nUltimately we stopped because neither of us could agree on how to say H. He insisted it was like SH but without the S and whatever sound he was making was not matching the lady on the screen and I kept contending that SH without the H is H lol.
