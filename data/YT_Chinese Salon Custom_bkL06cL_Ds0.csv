Thank you also for sharing the information about your language app at the beginning of your video. I'm super interested,  myself.  I feel, based merely on what I've seen & read, that the app may be a good fit for learners such as myself, who both prefer & rely on audio feedback/correction, in addition to the visuals of learning _(for example: seeing a word on the screen at the same time an audio pronunciation is being played helps me remember the sound that certain letter combinations may make in any given language).",0
