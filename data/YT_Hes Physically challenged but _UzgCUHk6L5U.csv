I gotta praise him for that somehow. Though I’m not quite sure if he’d be totally safe out there just sitting on the side of the street for too long. Someone might take advantage of him, but hopefully that won’t be the case ",581

He's such a sweet and kind person doing his best for his parents. And ted is also a nice person, we need more people like him to change the world and show that humanity still exists. Anu made my smile and cry because of his innocence. Such a wholesome and an amazing person!",19
He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@sanikaghumatkar5674,"I  have also met Anu during summer vacations of 2018 ...that time he was selling kiwis ....I remember my father tried to give him 1000 rupees without buying one....that time he denied and said I want to earn money..so buy kiwis and give me money....what an amazing person he is!..It's been 5 years I still have a photo of him and my dad posing for a nice photo..His innocent smile in the photo always makes me happy
 
Edit:-For those who kept asking where I met him...I met him in Dalai Lama's temple which is in McLeod Ganj (suburb near Dharmashala)",1500
He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@PreetMehta-lx1gj,"I have a brother just like him. I can't Express how happy am I right now seeing this. I wish I can help anu. My brother cant walk, cant talk and his hand movements are not even this good. It's so difficult so so difficult.  He is turning 25 this year and everyday I pray I can earn good enough for him to have a happy life. Coming from a middle class family it's so difficult to handle him and the money crisis.  But one day I'll help my brother and so many people like anu
You've earned my respect ted keep doing the good work ",282
He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@AT-eu4zu,"He’s not a victim, he’s a victor. 
And let me tell you something, these beautiful souls ARE WAY MORE ADVANCED than us. They are kind and loving because they are not because they have anything to gain. I work with beautiful people like him and THEY help me not me helping them. Please don’t be fooled. Disability is the one who doesn’t see, and I’m not talking with the eyes. 

It is my honour and dedication to be with them always so I may attempt to see and learn. 

Thank you for this beautiful soul ",3

He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@Pranayabhi08,3K can be spent in a shopping mall or a pub in a few hours. It hardly means anything then. But 3k shared to give happiness can mean the world to people like Anu. This is how one lives by his deeds. I will pray and wish people like you Ted earn more and more so that you can give more happiness and inspire others like us. More power and good health to you!,209

With all he has to go through in his own life, to still just push through and try his best through the kindness of his soul to help his mother… it truly humbles me.

He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@daizzstars,He kind of motivated me. The difference I can see is that he was born abnormal but we are mentally abnormal. His mental strength is soo much better than us normal people. I feel like we are losing motivation and dedication in our work but he besides having nothing is working hard in every possible way to cure his sick Mom. Now my problems can't be even called problems. Thanks for sharing such inspiring video!!️,222

He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@screenofspace,"Dear Ted Kunchok, I wanted to take a moment to express my deepest admiration for the incredible work that you do in helping those less fortunate. Your dedication and selflessness inspire me, and I know that your efforts are making a real difference in the lives of so many. It takes a special kind of person to devote themselves to the service of others, and you are that kind of person. Your willingness to lend a helping hand, to offer a listening ear, and to go the extra mile to make someone else's day a little bit better is truly remarkable.

You may not always see the impact of your work, but trust me when I say that it is there. You are planting seeds of hope and kindness that will continue to grow.. Your actions are changing lives and making the world a better place.

So when you're feeling tired or discouraged, remember that your work is important and valued. Remember that there are people out there who are grateful for everything you do. And remember that you have the power to create real, positive change in the world.

Thank you for all that you do. You are an inspiration to us all. Sincerely, ",290
He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@Nirajk19,"I've met this person in Mcleodganj, Dharamshala. I was there for a program. Back then he was selling some fruit at a secluded place near Dalai Lama temple, I think that's where Ted was pointing towards. I wanted to buy something from him, but due to being in middle of program I couldn't. Later on, a participant had went to his home, talked to his mom who's very old now. He told us she's really worried about him. I didn't see him after that day. Thank you Ted for helping him ",217
He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@indib3668,I pray he made it home safely and nobody messed with him. I worry people take advantage of him because he can’t defend himself. My heart hurts for him. I have a mother with cerebral palsy and she’s not as immobile as he is but I’ve met her friends and I’ve just always had a soft spot for the disabled,180

He’s Physically challenged but still working hard for his sick mom 😢 💔,0,0,@MysticalLibraries,"This video hit me like a ton of bricks. I had a cousin, who was dealing with the exact same condition and it is caused due to polio. He tried taking his life multiple times, left home on many occasions and we found him in a different state. As he continued to become an adult and saw his cousins getting married, he wanted to get married as well. He was adamant and mentally distressed. It was challenging to help him understand the situation or find a wife for him. He eventually took his wheelchair to the train tracks and put an end to his life at the age of 35. 
Since I have seen this situation first hand, it's really distressing for the person in question and their parents. I was very young to understand what his condition was and used to make fun of him. He wanted to run his own business, so his father got him a van and a shop near a temple. His demands kept growing and as well as his jealousy, which we cannot blame him for.",151

But just the fact that he went back to his ill mom like a normal responsible son with the “extra resources” to take care of her situation would make her so elated. The happiness on his face foreseeing this is priceless. I normally don’t like “advertised kindness” videos because I find it very hypocritical, but I liked this only cuz of the innocence of Anu’s reaction.",0
